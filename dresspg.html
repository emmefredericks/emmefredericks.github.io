        <span><p> Q-Tip Dress</p><p>Scholastic Art Award Winner</p><p>Handmade dress made entirely from Q-tips and cotton pads. Texture and dimension were the goals here as seen with the flapper-styled skirt, flared sleeves, and hand-folded cotton pad roses on the front. This was my first art project with complete creative control and I loved using a mix of mediums to create something totally new from its original purpose.</p></span>
