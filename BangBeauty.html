        <span><p> Bang Beauty Brand Identity</p><p>I created a brand identity and packaging for a fictional makeup line called "Bang Beauty." The inspiration behind the brand was the Pop Art art movement. Bang Beauty utilizes the same color palette and bold style traditional Pop Art does. The logo was designed to look like a classic Pop Art comic speech bubble. The line includes several different makeup products, all named after art terms and famous Pop Art artists.  </p></span>
